Steps for Distribution
Create a Configuration Profile:
In Jamf Pro, navigate to Computers and click on Configuration Profiles.
Click New to create a new profile.
Use the General payload to configure basic settings, such as the level at which to apply the profile and the distribution method.
Add other payloads (e.g., Software Updates, Dock, etc.) as needed.
Configure the scope of the profile to define which devices it applies to.
Upload the Installer Package:
Upload the MyApp installer package to Jamf Pro.
Ensure the package is properly signed and tested.
Create a Policy:
Navigate to Policies in Jamf Pro.
Click New to create a new policy.
Configure the policy with the following settings:
Trigger: Choose an appropriate trigger (e.g., Recurring Check-in).
Packages: Add the MyApp installer package.
Scope: Define the target devices (e.g., specific groups or all devices).
Execution Frequency: Set as needed (e.g., Once per computer).
Test the Deployment:
Deploy the policy to a test group of devices.
Verify that MyApp installs successfully and functions as expected.
Monitor and Troubleshoot:
Monitor the Jamf Pro logs for any issues during deployment.
Troubleshoot any errors encountered during installation.
Additional Notes
MyApp may require specific settings or configurations. Ensure these are documented and communicated to end-users.
Regularly review and update the configuration profile and policy as needed.
